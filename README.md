# Login-form 

In this project I wanted to practice validation in forms with a user friendly approach and simple aesthetics. 

The Javascript mainly consists of a few listeners that checks and validates the input fields whenever the user has added any new data to them. If a field is incorrectly filled out, then a little tooltip should emerge under the input field the user is currently editing, letting them know how they can fix it.

I also wanted to find out how hiding a password input worked, and it was more simple than i had anticipated, so the user is able to toggle password visibility on and off by clicking the eye icons.
